# langvision

langvision is a Python package for fine-tuning vision models using LoRA-based parameter-efficient adaptation. It is designed for research and production workflows involving image classification and related tasks.

## Features
- LoRA adapters for vision model fine-tuning
- Modular Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone
- Model zoo for open-source vision models
- Configuration system and CLI
- Checkpointing and resume support
- Distributed and mixed-precision training

## Installation

```bash
pip install langvision
```

## Basic Usage

```python
import torch
from langvision.models.vision_transformer import VisionTransformer

x = torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224)
model = VisionTransformer.from_pretrained("vit_base_patch16_224")
out = model(x)
```

## Command Line Interface

See `src/langvision/cli/finetune.py` for CLI usage and options.
